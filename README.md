# Diabetes Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on using a machine learning algorithm to detect diabetes in individuals. The dataset used for this project is obtained from Kaggle, and we perform data preprocessing, standardization, and implement a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to make predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project can be found on Kaggle. It includes various features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, age, and more, which are used to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes.

### Data Preprocessing

To prepare the data for modeling, we perform the following data preprocessing steps:

- Handle missing values if any.
- Explore the dataset for outliers.
- Perform feature engineering and selection.
- Examine the distribution of target variable.

## Feature Standardization

One significant observation during preprocessing is the high standard deviations of the columns. High standard deviations can affect the performance of some machine learning algorithms, so we standardize the data to have zero mean and unit variance using techniques like Z-score scaling.

## Model Building

We use a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to build the diabetes detection model. The SVM algorithm is known for its effectiveness in handling classification tasks.

### Model Evaluation

We evaluate the model's performance on both the training and testing datasets. The goal is to ensure that the model generalizes well and does not overfit the data. The accuracy scores on both datasets are close enough, indicating that there is no overfitting.

## Final Model

After training the SVM classifier, we create a final model that takes input data as input. The input data is standardized, and then the model predicts whether the individual is diabetic or not.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning to detect diabetes in individuals based on various health-related features. The SVM algorithm, after thorough preprocessing and standardization, provides a reliable way to make predictions.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following libraries installed to run the project:

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn

## Usage

To use the final model for diabetes detection:

1. Input the relevant health-related data.
2. Standardize the input data.
3. Feed the standardized data into the trained SVM model.
4. The model will return whether the person is diabetic or not.
